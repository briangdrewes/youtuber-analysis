# youtuber-analysis
Portfolio project to analyze the income and viewership by category, country, etc. in YouTubers from a dataset found on Kaggle.

be_a_youtube_mrbeast.ipynb is the final notebook structured for presentation, look at this file if you want to see my organization, code-work and analyses on findings.


draft.ipynb is a file that I used for my random charting and analysis without a presentation in mind. If you are interested in seeing how my randomly exploring brain looks through data thats the spot for it.
